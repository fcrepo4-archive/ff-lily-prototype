Fedora tries its luck with Lily.

You must have a running Lily repository to run this. Lily is not embedded!

It should be available at Zookeeper address "localhost:2181", or you can change the config in
WEB-INF/rest.xml.

The only methods currently implemented are POST/GET for /objects and GET for /fedora/describe.
