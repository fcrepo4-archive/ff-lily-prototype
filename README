Fedora tries its luck with Lily.

You must have a running Lily repository to run this. Lily is not embedded!

<<<<<<< HEAD
It should be available at Zookeeper address "localhost:2181", or you can change the Spring config in WEB-INF/rest.xml.

The only methods currently implemented are POST/GET for /objects and GET for /fedora/describe.

To add a new JAXRS resource, create it as a subclass of AbstractResource, then add it to Spring config with a constructor-arg of the LilyClient bean, like:

<jaxrs:serviceBeans>
            <bean id="fedoraRepository" class="org.fcrepo.lily.FedoraRepository">
                <property name="client" ref="lilyClient"/>
            </bean>
            ...
</jaxrs:serviceBeans>

That's dumb. It's too much work. We should make the LilyClient a service of some kind. OSGi?
